# Document Classifier

The study of natural language processing has been around for more than 50 years and grew out of the field of linguistics with the rise of computers. Recently, more and more employers are looking for data scientists who are knowledgable in the field and look to utilize the information and power hidden in the vast literature about every possible topic. 

Document classification is an example of Machine Learning (ML) in the form of Natural Language Processing (NLP). By classifying text, we are aiming to assign one or more classes or categories to a document, making it easier to manage and sort. This is especially useful for publishers, news sites, blogs or anyone who deals with a lot of content.
